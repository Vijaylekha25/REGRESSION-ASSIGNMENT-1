    "Intercept: It is the value of the dependent variable when all independent variables are zero. It might not always have a meaningful interpretation.\n",
    "Example: In a linear regression predicting exam scores based on study hours, a slope of 0.5 would mean that for every additional hour of study, the exam score is expected to increase by 0.5 points. The intercept might represent the expected exam score if the student did zero hours of study, which might not be meaningful."
